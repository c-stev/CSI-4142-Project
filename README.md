## Project Description
Yahoo! Finance is a powerful source of financial information, including but not limited to stocks, bonds, currencies,
and cryptocurrencies. For this endeavour, publicly traded company data within various sectors will be examined. These sectors
include, but are not limited to, Healthcare, Technology, Financial Services, and more. This information will be
extracted, analyzed, and compared with the other sectors to gain more of an understanding of the relative
stability, volatility, and profitability of each sector. The conclusions that will eventually be drawn will offer valuable
insights that will aid decision-making, trend-analysis, and market understanding.
